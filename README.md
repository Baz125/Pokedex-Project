# Pokedex API Project Readme

## Overview

This project is a basic implementation of a Pokedex using the Pokedex API. It allows users to load and display Pokemon data, view a list of Pokemon, and click on individual Pokemon to see more detailed information. This readme provides an overview of the project, its features, and the programming techniques used.

## Features

### 1. Loading data from an external source
- The project utilizes the Pokedex API to fetch Pokemon data, including details such as name, image, and type.

### 2. View a list of Items
- The fetched Pokemon data is displayed in a user-friendly list format, making it easy for users to browse through and identify Pokemon.

### 3. Click to See More
- Users can click on a specific Pokemon in the list to view more detailed information about that Pokemon, including its abilities, height, weight, and other relevant attributes.

### 4. Search
- User can type in the search box to filter the diplayed pokemon to only those containing the search term in the Pokemon's name

## Tecnologies/Techniques used

### 1. JavaScript
- The project is primarily developed using JavaScript to fetch data from the Pokedex API, handle user interactions, and dynamically update the user interface.

### 2. HTML and CSS
- HTML and CSS are used for structuring the web page and styling the user interface to provide an attractive and responsive design.

### 3. Asynchronous Programming
- Asynchronous programming techniques, such as Promises and the `async/await` syntax, are employed to handle API requests and ensure a smooth user experience without blocking the main thread.

### 4. Event Handling
- Event listeners are utilized to capture user interactions, such as clicking on a Pokemon, and trigger the appropriate actions to display more information.

### 5. DOM Manipulation
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is manipulated dynamically to update the displayed data as the user interacts with the application.

### 6. Responsive Design
- The project incorporates responsive design principles to ensure that the Pokedex is accessible and user-friendly on various screen sizes, including mobile devices and desktops.

## Deployment
 - The Pokedex is deployed on Github Pages: https://baz125.github.io/Pokedex-Project/
